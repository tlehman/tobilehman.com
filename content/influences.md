These are the people and ideas that influenced me, and for whose work I am grateful.

- [Coding Horror's Jeff Atwood](https://blog.codinghorror.com/)
  - I started reading this blog in 2005 when I was learning to write code. I discovered it through [Google Reader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Reader).
- [Professor Karla Fant](http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~karlaf/)
   - Her classes on algorithms and data structures in C++ have stuck in my memory vividly. Her teaching style is unique, high energy, and dense with nerdy movie references.
- [Gwern](https://www.gwern.net/index)
  - I have known about Gwern for at least 10 years, mostly through [LessWrong](https://lesswrong.org). However, I started reading his site in 2020, and loved the detail he has put into his website. I copied the `::after` link styles, so that links have identifying icons after them. 
- [Julian Lehr](https://julian.digital)
  - His site theme inspired my terminal
