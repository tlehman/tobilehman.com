I am a self-taught computer programmer living in the Pacific Northwest.

I studied mathematics at [PSU](https://pdx.edu) and went right back to programming after graduating.

My professional life has been centered around backend web development, real-time data processing and streaming video. I am currently doing web development to support the [Amazon Scout](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/transportation/whats-next-for-amazon-scout) delivery robots.

I am also studying electrical engineering online through [University of Colorado Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu/ecee/academics/online-programs/master-science-electrical-engineering) to deepen my understanding of robotics.
