I studied mathematics and computer science at [PSU](https://pdx.edu). 

I currently work at [Amazon Scout](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/transportation/whats-next-for-amazon-scout), developing teleoperations software to drive the robots.


### Some notable things I did
- I built the network recovery software for the [AWS Elemental Link](https://aws.amazon.com/medialive/features/link/) in 2020
- I wrote a 2D physics simulator and [presented it in 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaSPcs8Y6gc&list=PLE7tQUdRKcyb0PFcp3rGqDb7xnM6c531Z&index=10&t=1s)
    - [Object-Oriented Orbits source code](https://github.com/tlehman/ooo/blob/master/ooo.org)
    - [Object-Oriented Orbits slides](/pdf/ooo.pdf)
- I was the sole winner of the 2011 Putnam Mathematical Competition at PSU. [Picture of plaque for proof](/images/putnam-2011.jpg)
