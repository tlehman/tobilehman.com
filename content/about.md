I am an experienced software engineer with a background in math.

I studied mathematics and computer science at [PSU](https://pdx.edu). 

I currently work at [Apple](https://apple.com) as a contractor, working on network optimization using the [ServiceTalk](https://github.com/apple/servicetalk) Java library.


### Some notable things I did
- I wrote the [PCI Passthrough](https://github.com/harvester/pcidevices) Kubernetes operator for [SUSE](https://suse.com)'s Harvester hyperconverged infrastructure operating system.
    - Here's [my post](/posts/suse-harvester-pci/) explaining what it does and how it works
- I built core parts of the telemonitoring software for the [Amazon Scout](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/transportation/whats-next-for-amazon-scout) delivery robots.
- I built the network recovery software for the [AWS Elemental Link](https://aws.amazon.com/medialive/features/link/) in 2020
- I wrote a 2D physics simulator and [presented it in 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaSPcs8Y6gc&list=PLE7tQUdRKcyb0PFcp3rGqDb7xnM6c531Z&index=10&t=1s)
    - [Object-Oriented Orbits source code](https://github.com/tlehman/ooo/blob/master/ooo.org)
    - [Object-Oriented Orbits slides](/pdf/ooo.pdf)
- I was the sole winner of the 2011 Putnam Mathematical Competition at PSU. [Picture of plaque for proof](/images/putnam-2011.jpg)
