Every once in a while, a new book is published that is simultaneously:

 - historically aware
 - timely and relevant
 - counterintuitive and non-trivial

Andrew McAffee is an economist at MIT, in his book he makes a bold claim:

<div class="yellow-note">
<b>The U.S. economy has been getting "more from less" since 1970</b>
<p>
Specifically, it has been using less energy, materials and land per dollar of GDP output.
</p>
</div>

The historical awareness he brings to the book is that from the dawn of the Industrial Revolution to around 1970, the only way the economy grew was if energy and material usage grew. However, that relationship became uncoupled around 1970, so that GDP continued to grow exponentially, but energy usage started to plateau. McAffee's story about why this happened has four main characters: capitalism, technological progress, public awareness and responsive government. He calls these the Four Horsemen of the Optimist.
