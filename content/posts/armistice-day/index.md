One hundred years ago today, the armistice was signed that ended World War 1.
Now is a good time to reflect on the last century and get some perspective. Below is 
a chart of all the combat deaths per 100,000 people going back to the year 1900.

One of the things that stands out about this is the sheer scale of WW1 and WW2 compared to 
every other war during that time. **It's also worth noting how unusually peaceful the current 
time is.** That is a good reason to celebrate, but it also should remind us that this 
peace is not normal, and should not be taken for granted.

I would like to thank all the men and women in uniform, the members of the intelligence community, 
and the diplomats that negotiate ceasefires and peace treaties. Your work has made the world a 
more peaceful and safe place to live, and for that I am grateful. ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸
