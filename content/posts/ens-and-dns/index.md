Today [a DAO just distributed 1.5 billion dollars worth of ENS tokens](https://twitter.com/nileshtrivedi/status/1458002617439825920). They were distributed to owners of .eth domains. DAO is short for "Decentralized Autonomous Organization". 

**What is a DAO?** A DAO is sort of like a corporation, but it's stored on the Ethereum blockchain. [Wyoming passed a DAO law](https://www.wyoleg.gov/Legislation/2021/SF0038) that links on-chain DAOs to real corporations. The corporation that currently manages the Domain Name Service (DNS) is [ICANN](https://www.icann.org/).

**What is DNS again?** DNS is the system that translates names like "google.com" to IP addresses like 142.250.189.238
Remember when Facebook went down for 6 hours last month? That was a DNS failure. When autocratic regimes want to block the internet? They do it by blocking it at the DNS level. Like when [Turkey blocked Google's DNS server](https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/google-confirms-turkey-is-blocking-its-dns-service/), 8.8.8.8 back in 2014.

**Just what is ENS and how is it different from DNS?** ENS is the Ethereum Name Service. Instead of registering the mapping between names and IP addresses with an ICANN-approved top-level-domain like .com, you can register a name ending in .eth in the public blockchain. The public blockchain is immutable, so it can't be accidentally deleted, nor can it be censored by tyrants.

**What are the $ENS tokens that just got airdropped today?** The tokens can be sold, or used for governance of the ENS protocol. In exchange for voting, .eth domain holders who bought before October 31st are eligible to [claim their ENS tokens](https://claim.ens.domains/). Using these tokens, you can vote on the constitution, vote on other protocol design decisions, and also get rewards for registering further domains. 

**How was the $3 billion total of $ENS tokens distributed?**
 - 50% Community Treasury
 - 25% Airdropped to early adopters
 - 19% to Core Contributors
 - 6% combined to other (see [tweet](https://twitter.com/ensdomains/status/1455754478477619200))

This is an experiment in protocol governance that pays open source contributors and early adopters. If this project succeeds, then it will be an alternative to DNS on the web, [free of the politics of ICANN](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/mar/14/icann-internet-control-domain-names-iana).
