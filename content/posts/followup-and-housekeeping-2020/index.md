[Earlier this year](/posts/fast-covid19-testing) I got excited about a faster way to do COVID-19 testing using RT-LAMP instead of PCR. It's been over two months, and I wanted to follow up on this exciting result.

This recent [mini review](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S266605392030014X) said it's still not here.

I was afraid of that, sounds promising in the lab, but not going to hit the shelves fast enough to make a difference. I'll keep my eye on this technology, but I am not holding my breath.

Also, my [3D printed sliding door](/posts/diy-sliding-door-fix/) fix still didn't solve the problem, the sliding door is so bent that the support I made didn't stop the whole thing from coming off the rails again.

Usually I am an optimist, but I want to make sure I stay transparent when I get overly optimistic.
