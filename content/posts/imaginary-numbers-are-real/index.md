If you have ever taken a high school math class, you were probably introduced to **imaginary numbers**, which are defined like this:

$$ i^2 = -1 $$

The number \\(i\\) is called "imaginary" because it is not a quantity of something like positive numbers. Positive numbers
squared can be interpreted geometrically. If \\(x\\) is a length,
then \\(x^2\\) is the **area of a square with sides of length \\(x\\)**,
and area is always positive.


But what if \\(x\\) is negative? Negative lengths don't make sense, but negative money does, debt is a way of making sense of
having negative money.

Okay, negative numbers make sense, but imaginary numbers still seem bogus. Where would someone come up with something like this?

## Discovering imaginary numbers

To figure out where imaginary numbers come from, we can start by taking a trip to \\(\mathbb{R}\\), the real line.
