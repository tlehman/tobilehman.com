Something amazing happens every time you snap a picture on your phone, 
light travels in through a lense into an array of sensors, triggering 
electric signals that get processed by a computer and stored as a list 
of pixels.

The pixels on most screens emit three different colors, 
{{<red "red">}}, {{<green "green">}} and {{<blue "blue">}}. The reason 
those colors where chosen is because human color perception is enabled 
by [cone cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cone_cell), with cells 
that respond to red, green and blue light.
