In 1666, when the Plague was ripping through England, Isaac Newton went into quarantine outside the city and developed calculus. Calculus is an application of Euclid's geometry to problems involving time. Geometry models space, calculus models space and time.

The reason the ancient Greeks didn't develop calculus is because of tools. The ancient Greeks had rulers and compasses but not reliable clocks. They used the rulers and compasses to do geometry, and discovered many eternal truths about space and shape.

The first precise clock was invented by Dutch mathematician Christiaan Huygens in 1656, it used a pendulum. And it reduced the loss of time by clocks from about 15 minutes per day to about 15 seconds per day. That's a 60x improvement in accuracy.

Given that small intervals of time could be practically measured, the technological environment in Europe became ripe for someone to develop calculus. It's no surprise that both Leibniz and Newton both arrived at equivalent new mathematics! 

In Newton's theory of gravity and motion, he models time as a universal sequence of "nows". In his model, it is as if God has a clock that defined a single now for all points in space.

In this model, it's possible to define simultaneity between any two points in space, no matter how far apart.

In 1750, less than 100 years later, Benjamin Franklin discovers that lightning is made of electricity, and invents the lightning rod. Soon after, a man named Hans Christian Ørsted discovered that electricity can create magnetic fields. Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, people tinkered with electricity and magnetism, building on Ørsted's discoveries, and discovered the rules that govern those two intertwined forces. The Scotsman James Clerk Maxwell was like Euclid, a unifier who took the existing body of knowledge that existed scattered around and summarized it all in a set of four equations:
    - Gauss' Law: $$\nabla \cdot \bold{E} = 4 \pi \rho$$
    - Gauss' Law for magnetism: $$\nabla \cdot \bold{B} = 0$$
    - Faraday's Law of induction: $$\nabla \times \bold{E} = -\frac{1}{c}\frac{\partial\bold{B}}{\partial t}$$
    - Ampere's circuital L: $$\nabla \times \bold{B} = -\frac{1}{c}(4\pi\bold{J} +\frac{\partial\bold{E}}{\partial t})$$
- In the early 1900s, a young patent clerk named Albert Einstein had known all of this, and was struggling with trying to reconcile Maxwell's theory of electro-magnetism and old Newton's theory of gravity. Both were correct, within their respective domains, but they gave contradictory answers to certain basic physical questions.
- For example, using Maxwell's equations, you can show that any observer should measure the speed of light as the same number: 299,792,458 m/s. But in Newton's model, if an observer is traveling at half the speed of light in the direction of a light beam, they should measure the relative speed of the light as only half that.

- One of the things Einstein was excellent at was taking simple ideas seriously, and then rigorously exploring their consequences. By 1905, he had found a solution, but it involved changing the assumptions about how time worked. in software terms, Einstein tried to merge Newtonian mechanics and Maxwellian dynamics, but there was a merge conflict, and it was resolved by deleting the idea of a universal "now".
- If the speed of light is the same for all observers, then it logically follows that time has to be relative. This is the central idea of relativity. Newtonian mechanics has the speed of light as relative, and time as absolute, but relativity has the speed of light as absolute, and time as relative.
- One way to visualize the universe in Einstein's model is to imagine a cone of light in spacetime
- {{[[TODO]]}} Insert picture of spacetime in relativity 
- {{[[TODO]]}} Talk about Einstein's definition of simultaneity and [[H. Putnam]]'s transitive argument that leads to the conclusion that time is an illusion 
- {{[[TODO]]}} expand on how this line of thinking leads to the [[Block Universe]]
- Segue into [[Lee Smolin]]'s idea of "physics in a box", and his approach which takes time as primitive and real, and define Presentism vs Eternalism
- {{[[TODO]]}}  Briefly discuss [[Carlo Rovelli]]'s "End with [[Carlo Rovelli]]'s arXiv paper about "Neither Presentism nor Eternalism""
