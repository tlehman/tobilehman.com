This book develops a theory of a cyclical pattern in the economy. The pattern describes how certain new technologies spread to become a whole new way of structuring society. The author Carlota Perez calls this a technological revolution and it's associated "techno-economic paradigm".

In this review I want to summarize her theory using less jargon. Even though the book reads like an academic text, and the jargon is used consistently, I want to dig into the idea in more common language.

The lifecycle of a new revolutionary technology follows an S-curve trajectory like this:

The cyclical pattern has a period of around 50-60 years, and it starts with a new technology becoming commercially viable. This is the *big bang* event that kicks off the beginning of a new cycle. Examples include James Watt's steam engine (1774), Henry Ford's Model T (1908), or Gordon Moore's microprocessor (1971). The big bang and the next 10-15 years are the **Irruption phase**. Then Finance sweeps in and accelerates the spread of this new technology, leading to the **Frenzy phase**, this is creates an asset bubble. Historical examples include the 1920s (Frenzy phase of the 3rd great surge, of oil & cars), and the 1990s (of personal computers & the internet).

The Frenzy phase always ends when the bubble pops. The crash leads to the **turning point**, where social and political forces sweep in to clean up the mess. If done responsibly, this leads to new institutions and regulations that can re-couple finance and production, and lead to the **Synergy phase**, where there can be much broader-based growth, with rising wages and rising productivity at the same time.

One quick side-note on bubbles:

The theory describes a **feedback loop** between **finance capital** and **production capital**.
