I wrote [pdf2png](https://github.com/tlehman/pdf2png) to make a fast PDF to PNG converter, uses C.

I wrote [manipulate-mediastream](https://github.com/tlehman/manipulate-mediastream) to learn how to process data from a WebRTC stream and render it 
in an HTML5 `<canvas>` element

To calculate the number of [sats](https://bitcoin.org://bitcoin.org/en/faq#what-is-bitcoin) per U.S. penny, I wrote a [sats calculator](https://tobilehman.com/sats)

I wrote [math-canvas.js](https://tobilehman.com/js/math-canvas.js) so I could write my post explaining
why [Imaginary Numbers are Real](https://tobilehman.com/posts/imaginary-numbers-are-real)

For the post about the [timelapse](https://tobilehman.com/posts/timelapse) I took of my tree, I wrote some [python code](https://github.com/tlehman/timelapse-cam) to extract the JPG images from the camera and make a video

### The [Ise Grand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ise_Grand_Shrine) Go program

There's some backstory here. My [friend](https://twitter.com/ryanspangler) taught me how to play Go back in 2011. 
I wrote a mostly-working Go program in JS in 2014, then re-wrote it in Ruby in 2014, then re-wrote it again in 2018. 
The reason I call it Ise Grand is because the Ise Grande Shrine in Japan is **rebuilt every 20 years**, and has been for 1300 years. 
I keep rewriting the game to make it better, and never get around to playing it.
