Instead of writing a dry and formal list of acknowledgements, I want to thank the many people and communities that built the tools I use to make this website.

## Thank you to:
 - the [Hugo static website framework](https://gohugo.io/) 
 - the [Go Programming Language](https://golang.org/)
 - [@luizdepra](https://github.com/luizdepra)'s "Coder" theme for Hugo
