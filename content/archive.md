   - _This was the first computer game I played. My dad would play me on his old DOS laptop._
- 1981-02-01 (BBC: Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy) [hgttg.mp3](https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/tobilehman.com-archive/hgttg.mp3)</li>
    - _This was recorded by my dad in 1981, then digitized as a WAV file around 2002.

I am archiving it here for the world to benefit from. The only advice I give to the next listener of this file is: Don't Panic.
