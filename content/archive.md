- 1981-02-01 (BBC: Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy) [hgttg.mp3](https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/tobilehman.com-archive/hgttg.mp3)</li>
    - _This was recorded by my dad in 1981, then digitized as a WAV file around 2002. My dad introduced me to this gem, and I enjoyed listening to it on my [MuVo MP3 player](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_MuVo) while on a train_. I am archiving it here for the world to benefit from. The only advice I give to the next listener of this file is: Don't Panic.
