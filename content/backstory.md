## Backstory (in third-person)

Tobi is self-taught computer programmer who started working while in high school.
Through a serendipitous meeting of someone in his high school computer science class in 2005, he went to work at 
[HBW Leads LLC](https://hbwleads.com) and taught himself C# and SQL. He used those technologies to increase 
the productivity of telemarketers who were trying to help people save money on insurance. It was there that he 
developed a love of automation and efficiency.

After two years of real-world experience developing software, he went to 
[Portland State University](https://www.pdx.edu/themes/custom/pdxd8/favicon.ico) to study computer science and math.
Having a low SAT score, he had to learn mathematics from a remedial start, and spent 5 years in undergradate. He worked 
his way up to partial differential equations and algebraic topology, and earned a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics, with a 
3.7 GPA. It was there that he learned C++ and [Nvidia CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone), which can be used to 
make _very fast programs_.

Working as a web developer at [Goldstar Events](https://www.goldstar.com) he helped scale a monolithic web application from 
5 million to over 15 million users.  He also built an experimental ledger system aimed at efficiently allocating complimentary 
event inventory.

As a software engineer at [FlightStats](https://flightstats.com), he developed high-performance flight data processing applications.
It was there he learned the importance of good leadership and management.

Starting in 2018, he joined [Amazon](https://amazon.com), initially working on [streaming video](https://www.elemental.com/), he transitioned to 
[robotics](https://blog.aboutamazon.com/transportation/whats-next-for-amazon-scout) in 2020. 
Working on robots was a deliberate move based on his observation of the major bottlenecks that he observed during the coronavirus-induced recession.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, he noticed that delivery times for packages and groceries had skyrocketed, and this surge in demand laid bare a problem 
that needed a solution. Even though [Amazon had hired 175,000 people](https://blog.aboutamazon.com/company-news/amazon-hiring-for-additional-75-000-jobs), 
there were still customers who need to be served faster. Given the disappointing state of robotics, he took the initiative of seeking out a team 
developing robots to deliver packages, and joined the team to help them make it a reality.
