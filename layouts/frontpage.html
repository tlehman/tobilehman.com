        Welcome to <a href="https://tobilehman.com">tobilehman.com</a>.
        
        (Yes the terminal is real)
        <p>
          This site has my <a href="/posts">blog posts</a>,
          the <a href="/projects">projects</a> I've worked on, and
          a section <a href="/about">about me</a>. I write about books I've read, 
          technologies I've worked with, programs I've written, and historical 
          developments that I find interesting.

        I believe every problem can be solved. I also acknowledge that every solution creates it's own problems. 
        Overall, I believe that the rate of solution-production is greater than the rate of problem-production, which 
        means that human life is getting better over time. Further, I believe it's our moral responsibility to 
        understand the root causes of that progress, and to do whatever we can to continue and even accelerate that progress.

        I chose to work on software enabling remote control of robots. It is a complement to autonomy software, 
        whose success means no human intervention. We are in a transitional period in history where AI still lags behind 
        general human intelligence, and the COVID-19 pandemic has forced a lot of people into remote work. The tools for 
        doing office-style remote work are mature. Remote manual labor is still in its infancy. There is tremendous room for 
        progress in this area.

          If you are interested in accelerating progress with me, consider <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xpgBJdTSk5WULQSb5vZwEwhS-UtKheEICqESxWaTjMw/edit?usp=sharing">joining my book club</a>.
          Currently we are reading <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Where-Flying-Car-Storrs-Hall/dp/1953953182">Where is my Flying Car? by J. Storrs Hall</a>
          Started (2021-12-06), we are planning on meeting up to talk about it sometime before new years. If you are interested, go to the Google doc and we can take notes and plan there.
